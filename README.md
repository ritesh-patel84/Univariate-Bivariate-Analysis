# Univariate-Bivariate-Analysis
Before we build our model lets first understand the given data by performing univariate and bivariate analysis. We do univariate analysis to summarise and describe individual variable and find pattern in it and Bivariate analysis is done to check corelation between each variable in the dataset with the target variable.
